# Parking-Perfect-10
Parking Perfection is a C++ based game for parking vehicle (TRUCK!!!)

This was developed as a high school project, pardon the code quality.

This game was just created for fun. Parking Perfection, as the name of the game says it all, allows you to be the driver to park all the vehicles that come to Vidya Mandir (High School) , without any damages made to the vehicles.

The game is made user friendly, and also has time limits so that the vehicles do not get stacked up and hence blocking the entrance.
Do check out instructions before you start playing the game for the first time and enjoy parking the vehicles before the time runs out in the allotted area.

Have fun, though without damaging the vehicles.
	
Happy Parking. Donâ€™t forget the time is running out!
